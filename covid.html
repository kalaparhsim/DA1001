    <p>
     The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major effect on our lives. 
    Many of us are facing challenges that can be stressful,
    overwhelming, and cause strong emotions in adults and children.
     Public health actions, such as social distancing, are necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19, but they can make us feel isolated and lonely and can increase stress and anxiety. Learning to cope with stress in a healthy way will make you, the people you care about, and those around you become more resilient.
    </p>
<p>Stress can cause the following:</p>
    <ul class="a">
        <li>Feelings of fear, anger, sadness, worry, numbness, or frustration</li>
        <li>Changes in appetite, energy, desires, and interests</li>
        <li>Difficulty concentrating and making decisions</li>
        <li>Worsening of mental health conditions</li>
        <li>Difficulty sleeping or nightmares</li>
        <li>Physical reactions, such as headaches, body pains, stomach problems, and skin rashes</li>
        <li>Physical reactions, such as headaches, body pains, stomach problems, and skin rashes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is natural to feel stress, anxiety, grief, and worry during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>For all of these reasons, it's important to learn self-care strategies and get the care you need to help you cope.</p>

        <h1>From Pandemic to Endemic</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="covid5">
        <p>Human race has survived several outbreak of pandemics in the past and their impact was long lasting. Some of the recent pandemics have been caused by a viruses known as Coronaviruses (CoVs) which are diverse, complex, adaptable viruses that have a significant impact on human health and animal productivity.
        The novel coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 has quickly spread throughout the world.
        Human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2019 novel
         coronavirus (2019-nCoV, also known as SARS-CoV-2), have led to a global epidemic with high morbidity and mortality.
        Human pathogenic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting 
        enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidneys, and blood vessels.
        The efforts to contain the virus are undergoing throughout the world, given the many uncertainties regarding
        pathogen transmissibility and virulence. </p>

            <div class="tab">
                <p>Nietzsche is famously quoted “He who has a why to live can bear almost any how”. It’s normal for
                feelings of grief over a bereavement to be more pronounced when coupled with the uncertainty 
                caused by an event such as the coronavirus pandemic. They may also be accompanied by feelings of frustration or anger. Former chair of Palliative Care at La Trobe University and renowned expert in death, dying and end-of-life care, Professor Allan Kellehear, explains that “grief is a normal, sorrowful reaction to losing something or someone you love."

                "You can't love somebody and then lose them and not feel sorrow, feel grief. So it's normal, it's cross-cultural, it's universal, it's timeless. It won't destroy you."
                
                While everyone’s experience of grief or loss is unique, Professor Kellehear emphasises that it is rarely a one-off experience to be overcome.
                
                "It will come and revisit you. And you'll adjust to it differently when it comes back. You'll feel different about it in one year, in five years and in 20 years. It will be a part of your life because we are talking about attachment, relationships and love."</p>
                <p>During this crisis it is important to grieve what has been lost, and it is also important to find meaning and hope in how life has changes. We must find a why to live during such an unsettling time. Finding solace in new forms of connecting with others, utilizing space for being creative, and taking time to care for myself have all been helpful in reorienting meaning in my life. With this I can be hopeful. Hopeful that we can all get through this difficult time, hopeful that we may all gain a greater appreciation for the social connectedness, mobility, and routines that we have all lost, hopeful that we may all be strengthened by this trial and more focused on what is truly valuable and meaningful in life.</p>

                    On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days. </p>

            <label for="tabrose">3rd Wave</label>
            <div class="tab">
                <p>India now is in the middle of the third COVID-19 wave. The new cases have increased exponentially and
                     on 19 January 2022, India reported around 317,000 new COVID-19 cases. Nearly all states of India are showing an upward trend with a rise in test positivity rate (TPR). The active COVID-19 cases have reached a seven-month high, in spite of change in the case definition, where  a confirmed COVID-19 case is 
                     off the list of the active cases after seven days, against the earlier approach of being considered an active case for 14 days.</p>
                     <p>Alongside, the officially confirmed/reported Omicron cases in India, till 20 January 2022, stood at 9,200 only. The number of confirmed Omicron cases is based upon the genomic sequencing, which happens only on a very small subset of confirmed COVID-19 cases. However, in recent weeks, of all the samples genetically sequenced, the majority have been found to be Omicron with an upward trend. In Delhi, up to 90 percent of total samples sequenced were Omicron, and in Mumbai, this proportion was upward of 60 percent. Based upon genome sequenced data, the share of Omicron in all states are seeing a rise. We also know that Delta was the reason behind an unforgettable second wave in India and that the same variant is unlikely to cause a fresh wave.
                     Therefore, the third wave is being considered to be driven by Omicron.
                     </p>
                     <p>In the ongoing wave, there are a few silver linings as well. A majority of new infections—upto 80 percent to 90 percent confirmed cases—are asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. The occupancy of hospital beds, oxygen beds, and ICU beds has remained low (being termed as ‘de-coupling’ of SARS CoV2 infection from moderate to severe disease). People who are fully vaccinated are unlikely to develop symptomatic disease. There are other health systems factors that give some assurance. There are COVID-19 cases admitted in hospitals; however, the majority of COVID-19 dedicated beds are free. Then, there is the situation where a proportion of people who are admitted to occupy COVID-19 beds are ‘incidentally’ detected, when they were admitted for some other health conditions. They did not come to the hospital for COVID-19 symptoms but for other health conditions.
                          Nearly all COVID-19 patients in the ICU are those who are either unvaccinated or have pre-existing health conditions.</p>

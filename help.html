                <h2>Counselling</h2>
                <h2>Know your feelings are valid.</h2>
                <p1> Grief is messy and a natural response to loss. There are no right or wrong ways to
                     experience it. There are, of course, commonalities, but our response to loss is different for every person and also
                      for each person we lose. In general, grief begins acutely with intense emotions, preoccupying thoughts, physical 
                      reactions and behaviors focused on honoring, caring for and feeling close to the bereaved. Over time, as we 
                      adapt to the loss by accepting its reality and restoring our well-being, grief is integrated and finds
                       a place in our life.</p1>
                <h2>Understand that sudden loss is shocking and difficult to comprehend.</h2>
                <p2> After a painful loss, it’s easy to imagine ways it didn’t have to happen. This is something almost everyone does.
                     When a loved one dies suddenly, under difficult circumstances, as is happening with COVID-19 deaths,
                      the tendency to get caught up in imagining all kinds of alternative scenarios is even stronger.
                       This is called a “derailer” because it can sidetrack the adaptive healing process.</p2>
                <h2>Watch out for thoughts that can derail your healing process.</h2>
                <p3>If they take too much space in your mind, certain kinds of natural thoughts, feelings, or behaviors can derail
                     healing during acute grieving. These include protesting the death; self-blame, guilt, anger, or shame;
                      imagining ways things could have gone differently; losing faith in yourself or others; excessive avoidance
                       of reminders of the loss; and extreme social isolation.</p3>
                <h2>Don’t let guilt overwhelm you.</h2>
                <p4>You will likely find yourself feeling survivor guilt. This is very natural, but it is something to notice
                     and pay attention to while trying to not let it take over and guide your choices as you move forward.
                      In other words, you need to allow yourself to have joy and satisfaction in your life again. 
                      That might take a while. Just try not to hold yourself back from having positive emotions and savoring them.</p4>

            <h2>Stress Management</h2>
            <h3>Tip 1: Identify the sources of stress in your life</h3>
            <p1>To identify your true sources of stress, look closely at your habits, attitude, and excuses:
             <ul2>
                 <li>Do you explain away stress as temporary (“I just have a million things going on right now”) even though you can’t remember the last time you took a breather?</li>
                 <li>Do you define stress as an integral part of your work or home life (“Things are always crazy around here”) or as a part of your personality (“I have a lot of nervous energy, that’s all”)?
                </li>
                 <li>Do you blame your stress on other people or outside events, or view it as entirely normal and unexceptional?</li>
             </ul2>
             Until you accept responsibility for the role you play in creating or maintaining it, your stress level will remain outside your control.
            </p1>
            <h3>Tip 2: Practice the 4 A’s of stress management</h3>
            <p2>While stress is an automatic response from your nervous system, some stressors arise at predictable times:
                 your commute to work, a meeting with your boss, or family gatherings, for example. When handling such
                  predictable stressors, you can either change the situation or change your reaction. When deciding which
                   option to choose in any given scenario, it’s helpful to think of the four A’s: avoid, alter, adapt, or accept.
                   </p2>
                   <h3>Tip 3: Get moving</h3>
                   <p3>When you’re stressed, the last thing you probably feel like doing is getting up and exercising. But physical activity is a huge stress reliever—and you don’t have to be an athlete or spend hours in a gym to experience the benefits. Exercise releases endorphins that make you feel good, and it can also serve as a valuable distraction from your daily worries.

                    While you’ll get the most benefit from regularly exercising for 30 minutes or more, it’s okay to build up your fitness level gradually. Even very small activities can add up over the course of a day. The first step is to get yourself up and moving.</p3>
            <h3>Tip 4: Connect to others</h3>
            <p4>There is nothing more calming than spending quality time with another human being who makes you feel safe and understood. In fact, face-to-face interaction triggers a cascade of hormones that counteracts the body’s defensive “fight-or-flight” response. It’s nature’s natural stress reliever (as an added bonus, it also helps stave off depression and anxiety). So make it a point to connect regularly—and in person—with family and friends.

                Keep in mind that the people you talk to don’t have to be able to fix your stress. They simply need to be good listeners. And try not to let worries about looking weak or being a burden keep you from opening up. The people who care about you will be flattered by your trust. It will only strengthen your bond.</p4>
